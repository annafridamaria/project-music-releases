[Spotifys new releases w45 2019](https://frijon-music-releases.netlify.com/)

This is my first project working with react components. Using a response from the Spotify API, our task was to imitate the look of Spotifys new releases page.
Using the API and SVG icons, I created and rendered my album component for each release.
Since the focus of this assignment is to practice with React, we've downloaded a response from the Spotify API which you can use, rather than calling the API yourself.
